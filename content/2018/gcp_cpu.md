Summary: Steps and snippets to get started with a GPU instance on Google Compute Cloud (GCP)

If you, like me, want to learn more about GPU computing, in particular [Nvidia](https://nvidia.com)'s [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone), but not in the market for your own GPU right now, e.g. because you're waiting for the launch of Nvidia's next-gen hardware, renting a GPU instance from one of the major cloud providers appears to be easiest way to get started. I chose to go with [Google Compute Cloud (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com) for two reasons: 
- On top of the initial $300 GCP credits for signing up, I got my hands on additional promotional credits, valid for a year.
- GCP offers an [always free](https://cloud.google.com/free/) usage limits (for now), that may come in handy at some point.
